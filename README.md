Hi, I am Hari. I am interested in learning new technologies.
Currently I am exploring Spring, Spring Boot, Spring JPA, Hibernate. 
Along with Java technologies I am learning Microservices and Integration with Cloud (GCP, Azure and AWS).

Whole idea is to learn and gain as much as possible good level of knowledge which can help me to put myself in better position in the industry.

You can reach me over hari.sharma83@gmail.com

Regards,
Hari Sharma
